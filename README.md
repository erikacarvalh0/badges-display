This project was created to train some of my CSS animation skills. I wanted to animate SVG using CSS only, creating micro-interactions and animating SVG props.

The `src` folder contains all the code for the project and the `docs` folder is the builded version used by GH pages to host the project.

I used the simplest stack that I knew, in order to focus on the animation itself, so the project was built with *Pug/Jade*, *Stylus*, *JS vanilla* and *Parcel* as the bundler. This allowed me to dedicate myself on preparing all the assets and animating them.
